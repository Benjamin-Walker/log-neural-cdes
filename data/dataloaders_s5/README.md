# Data & Dataloaders
The scripts in this directory deal with downloading, preparing and caching datasets, as well as building dataloaders from (preferably) a cache
or downloading the data directly.  The scripts in this directory are **HEAVILY** based on the scripts in the original S4 repository, 
but have been modified to remove them from the PyTorch Lightning ecosystem.

These files were originally distributed under the Apache 2.0 license, (c) Albert Gu.  The original copyright therefore remains with the original
authors, but we modify and distribute under the permissions of the license.  Warranty, trademarking and liability are also therefore not allowed.
